    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Learn how to create basic HTML and CSS website by organizing styling images and text.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>HTML and CSS are the two primary languages you need to know to build a website. Although there are more<br>advanced ways to build a site
    all web developers must understand HTML and CSS regardless of other <br>technologies they use.<br><br>
    The course starts by exploring HTML tags and how to organize different types of information on HTML pages, HTML <br>
    or Hypertext Markup language describes a heirarchy of visual elements that a browser can display. You'll learn about <br> 
    the most common elements, like headers, paragraphs, tables and lists.<br><br>
    As you pick up HTML, the course will teach you CSS or Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML describes the meaning<br>
    and hierarchy of our content, it doesn't describe the <i>presentation</i> of HTML content. CSS allows you to combine vitality <br>
    and glamour to make your web site beautiful and engaging. <br><br>
    By the end of this course, you'll be able to combine HTML and CSS to make a web site.
